- Write a PCFG that models your sentences.
- To validate your grammar, parse the sentences with a parser of your choice.
- Then, generate 10 sentences  using a PCFG by experimenting with `nltk.parse.generate.generate` using different starting symbols and depths. Optionally, generate 10 sentences with PCFG.generate() (see section 4).
